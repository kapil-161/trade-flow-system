Got it — you want more advanced, technical, rule-based swing-trading frameworks using:
✔️ Weighted signals
✔️ ATR-based stops
✔️ Divergence
✔️ Multi-factor confirmation
✔️ Risk-managed entries

Below are 5 advanced, professional-grade swing strategies that include all the components you asked for.
(These are educational frameworks, not personal recommendations.)

⸻

✅ 1. Multi-Factor Weighted Momentum Strategy

A strategy where each indicator contributes a score, and trades trigger only when total weight exceeds a threshold.

Indicators & Weights Example

Indicator	Condition	Weight
EMA Trend	Price above 21 & 50 EMA	+3
Volume	Volume > 20-day average	+2
RSI	RSI 45–65 (healthy momentum zone)	+1
MACD	MACD > Signal	+2
ATR	ATR increasing (volatility expansion)	+2

Signal:
✔️ Enter long when score ≥ 7

Exit
	•	ATR-based trailing stop:

Stop = Entry Price – (1.5 × ATR(14))



Why it works

Multi-factor weighting reduces false signals and focuses on high-conviction setups.

⸻

✅ 2. ATR Volatility-Adjusted Swing Strategy

Focused entirely on volatility, not fixed stops.

Entry
	1.	Identify trend using EMA 34/89 crossover.
	2.	Enter when price pulls back to EMA34 and prints a bullish candle.
	3.	ATR must be rising, confirming volatility comeback.

Stop-Loss (ATR)

Stop-loss = Entry – (2 × ATR(14))
Take-profit = Entry + (3 × ATR(14))

Exit
	•	Trail stop using 1 ATR below swing lows.

Why it works

Stops scale with market conditions — tighter when calm, wider when volatile.

⸻

✅ 3. RSI + MACD Divergence Strategy (Momentum Reversal)

Uses hidden and regular divergences for precise swing reversal entries.

Entry Conditions

✔️ Price makes lower low,
✔️ RSI makes higher low → bullish divergence
✔️ MACD histogram rising from negative → positive
✔️ Price reclaiming 20 EMA

Stop
	•	ATR-based:

Stop = Swing low – 1×ATR



Target
	•	Resistance level
	•	Or fixed R multiple:

Target = 2R or 2.5R



Why it works

Divergence identifies weakness in trend before price turns — ideal for swing reversals.

⸻

✅ 4. Advanced Breakout + ATR Retest Strategy

Breakouts fail often — ATR filtering helps remove weak setups.

Entry
	1.	Identify resistance with at least 3 touches.
	2.	Breakout candle must be ≥1.2× ATR in size.
	3.	Volume must be ≥1.5× average.
	4.	On retest, enter only if candle stays above the level.

Stop

Stop = Retest level – (1 × ATR)

Targets
	•	2× ATR
	•	Or previous high

Why it works

Combines volatility, structure, and volume to catch early trend expansions.

⸻

✅ 5. Weighted Divergence + Trend Continuation Strategy

This hybrid strategy uses trend direction but confirms entry with momentum divergences.

Scoring System Example

Signal	Weight
Price above 200 EMA (macro trend)	+2
Price above 50 EMA (swing trend)	+2
Hidden RSI Divergence	+3
MACD histogram turning	+2
ATR rising	+1

Entry:
✔️ Take trade when score ≥ 6
✔️ Hidden divergence appears in direction of trend

Stop

Stop = Swing low – 1.2 ATR

Take Profit
	•	2× ATR OR
	•	Next resistance zone

Why it works

Hidden divergence signals continuation — powerful for multi-day momentum trades.
